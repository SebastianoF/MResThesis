%There are places where problems do not grow on steadfast certainties and in predictable directions.
%Places where there is little room to attempt any construction of solid, sleek and clean mathematical structures, but that demand nevertheless simplicity and precision.

%Here the language created following the abstract, self-contained and rigorous formalisms of pure mathematics is not reliable, exactly as is not reliable the knowledge of the initial condition of any studied phenomenon. Pure math borrowing some of their words and use them as tourists in a foreign land.

It was not and it is still not easy for me the trail between the study of pure mathematics and the world of medical imaging and biomedical engineering. This route would have never been possible without guides, who have gone before me through the same tortuous paths and who accompanied me in the last year. The main contribution on this side arrived from Marco Lorenzi. With the commitment of a supervisor, he helped me significantly, not only in the development of this thesis, but especially in having introduced me to many of the problems a researcher have to deal with.

I am also grateful to the rowing fellows with whom I shared commitment, challenges and happiness in this first fascinating and demanding year at the GIFT-Surg Project:

Guotai Wang and Maria A. Zuluaga.
Fundamental was also the contribution of Jenny Nerny, Rebecca Holmes, Katie Konyn and Liz Zuzikova, that allow students and graduates to focus more on research than paper work.

For the help in the unknown land of infinite dimensional Lie algebra, I have a debt with professor Karl-H. Neeb and dott. Robert Gray.

A non academic, but not less important contribution came on different sides from Andrea Baglione, Gerardo Ballesio, Filippo Ferraris, Valeria Giacosa, Giuliano `er Nuanda' De Rossi, Silvia Porter and Raoul Resta. 

The eclectic buildings of UCL would have been unseen for me without Tom Vercauteren, Sebastien Ourselin and Gary Zhang. Their work and their decision, in a warm day of June 2014, to offer me their support - other than a desk, a laptop and a coffee machine - opened the greatest and most important opportunity I've ever had.
 
In classical music, it is well known that in every concert the two most important tunes are the first one and the last one. Following here the same rule I terminate acknowledging for the great love, effort and patience, Carole Sudre.

\section*{Abstract}

%Medical imaging employs techniques and tools belonging to several branches of mathematics and physics that, when applied to morphometric and statistical study of biological shape variability, are collected under the name of \emph{computational anatomy}. 
Image registration is one of the critical tools in medical imaging. It consists in the process of aligning two or more patients images with the aim of determining and quantifying the occurring anatomical correspondences and differences. 

To model the anatomical variability from one image to the other the set of diffeomorphisms (bijective differentiable maps with differentiable inverse) appears to be an interesting option.

Comparing two diffeomorphisms, as well as obtaining any meaningful statistics for these elements, is not a straightforward task.
Approaching this problem, the \emph{log-Euclidean framework}, proposed to consider the set of diffeomorphisms with a Lie group structure, having a Lie algebra defined as the tangent space at the origin where to compute statistics.

In this local representation the operation of composition of diffeomorphisms is not anymore available. An operation in the tangent space that reflects the composition in the Lie group is therefore required.

Aim of this thesis is to find and compare numerical computations of this operation, called here \emph{log-composition}. 
A fast numerical methods for its computation would improve \emph{log-demons} registration algorithm.
