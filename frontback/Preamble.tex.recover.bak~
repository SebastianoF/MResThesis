%Since early anatomical studies, reproduction of images has been one of the main tool to investigate structures and differences in organs and organisms. 
%Better ways to represent reality have undoubtedly led to better ways to understand it, and the pioneers' work in each discipline sharing the common need for precise and detailed images, were aided by available techniques offered in every epoch.

%At the dawn, not surprisingly Artists and Anatomists could have not be separated, and every enhancement made in one field followed immediately others in other disciplines.
%Although semantics to differentiate fields of knowledge and art varied according to the epoch, the origin of every improvement in images ability reproduction has its roots in the study of Geometry.\\
%The first and most significant example is the powerful idea of perspective. Fixing a point from where to start infinitely parallel straight lines, leads, 16 centuries after their formalizations, Brunelleschi to revolutionize the  world's perception in artists' minds.
%Two centuries later, when the inventors' work took the name of Science, the study of magnifying lenses and their combination, made available new explorable territories. Here again the Geometry couldn't have more important role in the systematic study of the lights deformation effect through conic-shaped glass, and in the study of light itself  by Newton and Hyugens.\\
%Growing number of needs grows skills and techniques: artist, scientist and anatomist could not stay anymore below the same person's name, but what has remained constant is that every new discovery and improvement in one field became an immediate advancement in others.
%With the first stages of photographic techniques in the early '800, in parallel with the Young double slit experiment and its Fresnel interpretation, scientific community enhanced his attention to the shape of light. In late years of the same century the elegant Maxwell unification and its formalization by Heaviside determined the geometrical parameters of light. The discovery of X-ray by the first Nobel prize Roentgen and its refinement by Tesla is considered \cite{bradley2008history} the birth certificate of Medical Imaging, a domain destined to walk hand by hand with physics and engineering and to be eventually the most collaborative and crossing discipline ever seen. The transition from pencil's scientists and painting's artists to photographic equipment that characterizes this period did not impact only this newborn branch. Instruments brings literally light on the severe limits of human eye capabilities: what was hidden reality become visible. \\
%Just after the formalization of electric and magnetic field's shape, and the consequent mastery of electrical forces, the discovery of photoelectric effect opened new fields in the Physics of matter and a consequent new reformulation of mechanics far beyond the Cartesian space's Geometry, both in bigger and smaller scale. With the new interpretation of diffusion processes, there was been defined all the angular theories used also in the construction of fundamental equipment for medical imaging.\\
%In the wake of the third industrial revolution, electronic engineering, with its radio circuits, triods and valves destined to became transistor, provided each time better instrument to medical science where the acquisition and manipulation of patient images is a thriving theme. 
%Thanks to philanthropic, scientific and economic interest gravitating around health care, the complicated interaction between sciences, physics and medicine get smoothed leading to achievement as radiography, ultrasound, thermography, magnetic resonance, optical fiber, nuclear medicine, confocal microscopy just to name a few. Technologies aimed to visualize the interior of a body always attained from several parts to reach their aims. \\
%When photography get rid of photosensitive films to welcome digital sensors, images become stored in byte's grids with consequent powerful manipulation possibilities. The translation of acquired data from several sources, not always or entirely compatible with the human sight, to a suitable form meets new challenges.
%This is the context in which Machine Vision and Image Processing make their entrance; among the various advanced techniques, they provide two tools mostly utilized in medicine to reveal internal features and compare anatomies. Segmentation and registration suit as natural instrument in the investigation of patients' anatomies and physiologies. \\%Segmentation consists in enhance contours, detect edges and reveal hidden structure. .\\
%This Master Thesis deals with diffeomorphic image registration and, letting aside dribs and drabs history of science, still a few words about the state of the art are needed to complete its introduction.

\section*{Thesis' Organization and No(ta)tions}

The first chapter about the general framework in image registration and parametrization of diffeomorphisms for LDDMM and SVF is followed by three distinct part. The first one presents basic tools of differential geometry and parallel transport, with emphasis on the computational side. The second part is about the principal objects utilized to explore new numerical techniques and to compare them with the one currently utilized. The last part is devoted to the results for the computation on synthetic dataset and on patient images. \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{se:registration_framework}:}] Introduction of the registration framework. After a first section about the main definitions and concepts utilized throughout the thesis, general registration framework's features are presented. Particular attention is given to the pros ad cons of in the use of diffeomorphism as set of transformation between anatomies and some considerations about methods currently used for their parametrization: the LDDMM and SVF. 
	
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:finite_lie_group}:}] Possibilities of transformations' set when provided by mathematical structure of Lie group. Main mathematical elements and tools from Lie group theory directly involved in the image registration techniques are formally defined with a particular attention to flows, left translation, push forward, Lie logarithm and Lie exponential. We define the concept of Log-composition around which the research gravitates: it originates form the need of generalized the BCH formula. In this context the BCH become one possible way to compute the Log-composition. The second way to compute it in finite dimensional case, is provided by the Taylor expansion, presented in the last section.
	
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:parallel_transport}:}] BCH and Taylor expansion are two possibility to compute the Log-composition. A third one presented in this chapter originates by a geometrical approach and it is given by the parallel transport. First and Second sections are devoted to present the theoretical tools to define formally the parallel transport. Last section is about two strategies to compute the parallel transport without involving the Christoffel symbols: the Schild's Ladder and the Pole Ladder.
	
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:accelerating}:}] xxx
	
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:rigid_body_transformations} and \ref{ch:svf}:}] Validity of results in the Log-composition computations are tested with two groups of transformations commonly used in medical image registration: the group of rigid body transformation and the group of diffeomorphisms (expressed in the application as the set of Stationary Velocity Fields). These chapters are aimed to present them in details and they are oriented to the application. 
	
	
    \item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:application_log_composition}:}] This is the central part of the research. The Log-composition is analyzed as s valuable tool in image registration, within the framework presented in chapter \ref{se:registration_framework}. A summary of the methods for its computation is presented as possible numerical approximation to be utilized for image registration: BCH formula, Taylor expansion, parallel transport and Accelerating Convergences series. 
    
     \item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:lie_log_computation}:}] The algorithm for the Lie-logarithm computation presented in \emph{A new algorithm for the computation of the group logarithm of diffeomorphism} \cite{Bossa:08} is based on the computation of the BCH formula. If reformulated with the Log-composition, each of its numerical approximation is a valid tool to improve its performance. Of particular interests are the methods that avoid the computation of the BCH formula on which the algorithm was initially based.
     
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:results}:}] This chapter is devoted to experimental results. Performance of the Log-composition applied to rigid body transformation and diffeomorphisms are separately computed and compared. In addition a version of NiftyReg based on various we present the results of the numerical methods presented in the previous section, on synthetic data as well as on clinical data within a version of the  LCC-Demons customized with parallel transport.
	
	\item[{\bf Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions}}] Conclusion of what has been done so far (with a shameless and challenging emphasis of what is missing and what is still to be done).
