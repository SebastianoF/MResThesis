\section{Toward an ill-posed Problem}


Other than theoretical difficulties, there is another limitation in the utilization of diffeomorphisms, that comes down to the practical necessity of dealing with discrete images and to implement them in softwares. \emph{Two subset of some topological space have the same topology if exists an homeomorphism between them}: this analytical property do not holds if the objects involved are considered in a discretized space. Separated subset remains separated until their distance is less than the size of a voxel for a significant region; if this do not happen, even with a homeomorphic underpinning model, the discretization process do not preserve the topology.
