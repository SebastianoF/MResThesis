\noindent
In the previous chapter we have introduced some mathematical tools for the numerical computation of the log-composition. Each of the theoretical elements depends strongly on the transformations considered, and in this chapter we will see how they can be applied for the transformations belonging to $SE(2)$ and $\text{Diff}(\Omega)$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item[$SE(2)$ -] The group of rigid body transformation of the plane (any combination of bi-dimensional rotations and translations) is a good playground to test the numerical methods for the computation of the log-composition introduced so far, since results can be compared with a ground truth.
%	\item[$\text{Diff}(\Omega)$ -] The group of diffeomorphisms over $\Omega$, indcated with $\text{Diff}(\Omega)$ is defined over the wide set of all of the differentiable and invertible functions. For our applications we will restrict the set to the diffeomorphisms that can be parametrized by stationary velocity fields or SVF. This infinite dimensional vector space is the second algebra utilized to test the numerical methods for the computation of the log-composition. In this case we do not know any closed form, but considering an \lq\lq improper norm\rq\rq~ in the space of deformations it is possible to compare SVF and assess the quality of the results.

\section{The Lie Group of Rigid Body Transformations}\label{se:rigid_body_transformations}
% group
Each element of the group of rigid body transformation (or euclidean group) $SE(2)$ can be computed as a consecutive application of a rotation and a translation applied to any point $(x,y)^T$ of the plane:
\begin{align*}
\left (  
\begin{array} {c }
X \\
Y
\end{array}
\right )  
= 
R(\theta)
\left (  
\begin{array} {c }
x \\
y
\end{array}
\right ) 
+
t
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
\cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) 
\end{array}
\right )
\left (  
\begin{array} {c }
x \\
y
\end{array}
\right ) 
+
\left (  
\begin{array} {c }
t^x \\
t^y
\end{array}
\right ) 
\end{align*}
where the rotation matrix indicated with $R(\theta)$ belongs to the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$ and the translation $t$ is a vector of the plane.\\
We can represent the elements of $SE(2)$ in two different form: as ternary vector (restricted form) 
\begin{align*}
SE(2)^{v} 
:=
\{ (\theta, t^x, t^y) \mid \theta \in [0, 2\pi),   t^x, t^y \in\mathbf{R}^2  \}
\end{align*}
or with matrices (matrix form)
\begin{align*}
SE(2) 
:= 
\left \{
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
R(\theta) & t \\
0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right )
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c }
\cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta)& t^{x} \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & t^{y}\\
0 & 0 &  1
\end{array}
\right )
\mid
\theta \in  [0, 2\pi), (t^x, t^y) \in\mathbf{R}^2
\right \}
\end{align*}
The group $SE(2)$ it is a manifold with a differentiable structure compatible with the operation of composition, whose Lie algebra is given in matrix form by
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{se}(2) := 
\left \{
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
dR(\theta) & dt \\
0 & 0
\end{array}
\right )
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c }
0 & -\theta &  dt^{x} \\
\theta & 0 & dt^{y} \\
0& 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right )
\mid
\theta \in  [0, 2\pi), (dt^x, dt^y) \in\mathbf{R}^2
\right \}
\end{align*}
and it is indicated with $\mathfrak{se}(2)^{v}$ in its restricted form.

Given $r$, element of $SE(2)$ with $\theta\neq 0$, its image with the Lie group logarithm is
\begin{align*}
\log(r)
&=
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}~\frac{(r - I)^k}{k}
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
dR(\theta) & L(\theta)t \\
0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right )
\\
&=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c}
0   & - \theta& \frac{\theta}{2} (\frac{\sin(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)} t^x + t^y )\\
\theta & 0     & \frac{\theta}{2} (- t^x + \frac{\sin(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)} t^y )\\
0 & 0 &  0
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
where 
\begin{align*}
dR(\theta) = 
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
0 & -\theta \\
\theta & 0 
\end{array}
\right )
\qquad \qquad 
L(\theta) = 
\frac{\theta}{2}
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
\frac{\sin(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)} & 1 \\
-1 & \frac{\sin(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)}
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
On the way back, the exponential of $dr \in \mathfrak{se}(2)$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
\exp(dr)
&=
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{dr^{k}}{k!}
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
R(\theta) & L(\theta)^{-1}dt \\
0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right )
\\
&=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c}
\cos(\theta)   & - \sin(\theta)& \frac{1}{\theta} (\sin(\theta)dt^x - (1-\cos(\theta)) dt^y )\\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)     & \frac{1}{\theta} (- (1-\cos(\theta))dt^x + \sin(\theta) dt^y )\\
0 & 0 &  1
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
L(\theta)^{-1} = 
\frac{1}{\theta}
\left (
\begin{array} {c c }
\sin(\theta) & -(1-\cos(\theta)) \\
(1-\cos(\theta)) & \sin(\theta)
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
When $\theta$ is zero, $R(\theta)$ and $dR(\theta)$ coincide with the identity, and the transformation results in a translation. For proof and further details see for example \cite{gallier2011geometric} \cite{hall2015lie}.

At this point it is important to notice that: 
\begin{enumerate}
	%infinite series 
	\item The infinite series of matrices of equation \ref{eq:exp_as_inf_sum} does not raises any theoretical issue. An element of a group can be considered as a sum, where this operation is defined in the bigger algebra that contains both the Lie group and the Lie algebra. It appears to be the natural way to move back and forth from the group to the algebra. A second door to pass from one structure to the other, when the rotation $\theta$ is small is provided by the following approximations:
	\begin{align}\label{eq:small_rotation_matrices_approx}
	\exp(r) \simeq I + r
	\qquad 
	\log(dr) \simeq dr - I
	\end{align}
	In fact for small $\theta$, $\sin(\theta) \simeq \theta$, $\cos(\theta) \simeq 1 $ and $ L(\theta) \simeq I$.

	\end{figure}
	% restriction of the domain.
	\item The map $\exp$ is not well defined as bijection over its whole domain $\mathfrak{se}(2)$. Given two elements $(\theta_0, dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0)$ and $(\theta_1, dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)$, they have the same image with $\exp$ function if the two following conditions are both satisfied:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[i)] Exists an integer $k$ such that $\theta_0 = \theta_1 + 2k\pi$.
		\item[ii)] When $\theta_0 \neq 0$ the translation $(dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0)$ coincides with $(dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)$ up to a factor $\frac{\theta_0}{\theta_1}$, where the angles are considered modulo $2\pi$.
	\end{enumerate}
	To have a bijective correspondence the domain of $\exp$ has to be restricted to a space where if $\exp(\theta_0, dt^{x}_0,dt^{y}_0) = \exp(\theta_1, dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)$ implies  $(\theta_0, dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0) = (\theta_1, dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)$.
	It can be easy to prove that the sought space is the quotient of $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ over the equivalence relation $\sim$, defined as 
	\begin{align*}
		(\theta_0, dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0 & ) \sim (\theta_1, dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)
		\\
		&\iff_{\text{(by definition)}}
		\\
		\exists k\in\mathbb{Z} \mid \theta_0 = \theta_1 + 2k\pi 
		&~\text{ and }~
		(dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0) = \frac{\theta_0}{\theta_1}(dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)
	\end{align*}
	The new algebra defined by the set of equivalence classes of this relation is indicated - with the standard convention, see \cite{artin2011algebra} - with $\mathfrak{se}(2)/\sim$. With this restriction of the domain, the function $\exp$ is a bijection having $\log$ as its inverse.
	What said so far can be summarize in the following commutative diagram, where $\pi$ is the canonical projection:
	
	\[
	\begindc{\commdiag}[40]
	\obj(55,15)[u]{$\mathfrak{se}(2)/\sim $}

\subsection{Computations of Log-composition in $\mathfrak{se}(2)$}
The log-composition of two elements $dr_0 = (\theta_0, dt^{x}_0, dt^{y}_0)$ ans $dr_1 = (\theta_1, dt^{x}_1, dt^{y}_1)$ of $ \mathfrak{se}(2)/\sim$ results
\begin{align}\label{eq:log_composition_se2_closed_form}
& dr_0 \oplus dr_1 =  \log(\exp(dr_0)\circ \exp(dr_1)) 
\end{align}
The approximations of the log-composition using truncated BCH formulas are straightforward:
\begin{align*}
dr_0 \oplus dr_1 &\simeq  BCH^{0}(dr_0,dr_1 ) := dr_0 + dr_1  \\
dr_0 \oplus dr_1 &\simeq BCH^{1}(dr_0,dr_1 ) :=  dr_0 + dr_1 + \frac{1}{2}[dr_0, dr_1] \\
dr_0 \oplus dr_1 &\simeq BCH^{3/2}(dr_{0}, dr_{1}) :=  dr_0 + dr_1 + \frac{1}{2}[dr_0, dr_1] + \frac{1}{12}[dr_0,[dr_0, dr_1]] \\
dr_0 \oplus dr_1 &\simeq BCH^{2}(dr_{0}, dr_{1}) := dr_0 + dr_1 + \frac{1}{2}[dr_0, dr_1] + \frac{1}{12}([dr_0,[dr_0, dr_1]] + [dr_1,[dr_1, dr_0]] )
\end{align*}

To compute the approximation with the Taylor method, and so to compute the equation \ref{eq:taylor} for elements in  $ \mathfrak{se}(2)/\sim$, we observe that the restricted form of the Lie bracket is given by
\begin{align*}
[dr_0, dr_1] &= (0, dR(\theta_0)dt_1 - dR(\theta_1)dt_0)^T \\
& = (0, -\theta_0 dt^{y}_1 + \theta_1 dt^{y}_0 ,  \theta_0 dt^{x}_1 - \theta_1 dt^{x}_0)^T
\end{align*} 
Therefore, the adjoint operator can be written in matrix form as a dual matrix of $dr$:
\begin{align*}
\text{ad}_{dr} = 
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c}
0            &  0        &      0\\
dt^y       &  0        & - \theta \\
- dt^x   & \theta &  0
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*} 
In fact, when applied to $dr_1$ it results in the Lie bracket:
\begin{align*}
\text{ad}_{dr_0} dr_1= 
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c}
0            &  0        &      0\\
dt^{y}_0       &  0        & - \theta_0 \\
- dt^{x}_0   & \theta_0 &  0
\end{array}
\right )
\left (
\begin{array} {c }
\theta_1   \\
dt^{x}_1   \\
dt^{y}_1 
\end{array}
\right )
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c }
0  \\
-\theta_0 dt^{y}_1+ \theta_1 dt^{y}_0\\ 
 \theta_0 dt^{x}_1- \theta_1 dt^{x}_0
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*} 
To compute the Taylor approximation proposed in equation \ref{eq:taylor} of the log composition, indicating $dt^{\star} = (dt^{y}, - dt^{x})$ it can be proved easily by induction that
\begin{align*}
\text{ad}_{dr}^{n} 
= 
\left (
\begin{array} {c c}
0            &  0        \\
dt^{\star}      &  dR(\theta)      
\end{array}
\right )^n
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c}
0            &  0        \\
dR(\theta)^{n-1}dt^{\star}      &  dR(\theta)^{n}      
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
And so the series involved in the equation $\ref{eq:taylor}$ become
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_{n}}{n!} \text{ad}_{dr}^{ n} 
=
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_{n}}{n!} \left (
\begin{array} {c c}
0            &  0        \\
dR(\theta)^{n-1}dt^{\star}      &  dR(\theta)^{n}      
\end{array}
\right ) 
\end{align*}
We can split it in two part, the rotational part $dR(\theta)^{n}$ and the translational part $dR(\theta)^{n-1}dt^{\star}$. The rotational part, exploiting the nature of Bernoulli numbers and its generative equation, when $\theta \neq 0$, becomes
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_{n}}{n!} dR(\theta)^{n}  
&=
I + \frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2n}}{2n!} dR(\theta)^{2n}  \\
&=
I + \frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) + (\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2n}}{2n!} (i \theta)^{2n})I  \\
&=
\frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) + (\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_{n}}{n!}(i \theta)^{n} - \frac{1}{2} i\theta) I  \\
&=
\frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) + (\frac{i\theta e^{i\theta}}{e^{i\theta} - 1} - \frac{1}{2} i\theta) I  \\
&=
\frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) +  \frac{\theta /2}{\tan(\theta/2)} I  
\end{align*}
where the equation $dR(\theta)^{2n} =  (i \theta)^{2n}I  $. For the translational part we have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{B_{n}}{n!} dR(\theta)^{n-1} dt^{\star} 
&=
dR(\theta)^{-1} \Big(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{n}}{n!} dR(\theta)^{n}\Big)dt^{\star} \\
&=
dR(\theta)^{-1}  \Big(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_{n}}{n!} dR(\theta)^{n} - I \Big)dt^{\star}  \\
&=
dR(\theta)^{-1}  \Big(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) +  \frac{\theta /2}{\tan(\theta/2)} I  - I \Big) dt^{\star} \\ 
&=
dR(\theta)^{-1}  \Big(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}dR(\theta) +  \frac{\theta /2}{\tan(\theta/2)} I  - I \Big)dt^{\star} \\
&=
\Big(\frac{1}{2} I + (\frac{\theta /2}{\tan(\theta/2)} - 1)dR(\theta)^{-1}   \Big) dt^{\star}    \\
\end{align*}
Finally the closed form for the Taylor approximation of the log-composition is \cite{vercauteren2014preprint}:
\begin{align}
dr_{0}\oplus dr_{1}
=
dr_{0}
+
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{B_{n}}{n!} \text{ad}_{dr_{0}}^{ n} 
dr_{1}
+
\mathcal{O}(dr_{1}^2)
=
dr_{0}
+
\mathbf{J}(dr_{0})
dr_{1}
+
\mathcal{O}(dr_{1}^2)
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{J}(dr_{0})
=
\left (
\begin{array} {c c c}
1            &  0        &      0
\\
-\frac{\theta_0/2 - \tan(\theta_0/2)}{\theta_0\tan(\theta_0/2)}  dt^{x}_0 + \frac{1}{2}dt^{y}_0       
&  \frac{\theta_0 /2}{\tan(\theta_0/2)} 
& - \theta_0/2 
\\
-  \frac{1}{2} dt^{x}_0 -\frac{\theta_0/2 - \tan(\theta_0/2)}{\theta_0\tan(\theta_0/2)} dt^{y}_0       
& \theta_0/2 
&  \frac{\theta_0 /2}{\tan(\theta_0/2)}
\end{array}
\right )
\end{align*}
therefore the corresponding numerical method indicated with the function $\text{Tl}$ as
\begin{align}\label{eq:taylor_se2}
dr_{0}\oplus dr_{1}
\simeq
Tl(dr_{0}, dr_{1})
:=
dr_{0}
+
\mathbf{J}(dr_{0})
dr_{1}
\end{align}

The approximation of the log-composition using parallel transport is a straightforward application of the equation \ref{eq:parallel_transport}: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:parallel_transport_se2}
dr_{0}\oplus dr_{1}
&\simeq
pt(dr_{0}, dr_{1}) 
:=
dr_{0}
+
\exp\big(\frac{dr_{0}}{2}\big)   
\exp(dr_{1}) 
\exp\big(-\frac{dr_{0}}{2}\big)
-
I
\end{align}
where the composition in the Lie group coincides with the product of matrix in the bigger algebra $GL(3)$ that contains both the Lie group $SE(2)$ and the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(2)$.

\section{A Lie Group Structure for Diffeomorphisms}\label{se:svf}


The passage from the finite to the infinite dimensional case is not free of deceptions. We will investigate in the next two subsections, \ref{subse:local_isomorphisms} and \ref{subse:bigger_algebra} ,the following facts that are true matrices but not for diffeomorphisms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lie logarithm and Lie exponential are local isomorphisms.
	\item $SE(2)$ and $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ are subset of a bigger algebra, where all of the operations are compatible.
\end{enumerate}
To avoid ambiguities, we first need to write down some definitions and facts.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\hspace{-1.5cm}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/se2_circular_vector_field.pdf}
	\caption{The displacement field and the tangent vector field for the transformation $\varphi$ defined as a rotation of $\pi / 6$ around the origin. When $\varphi$ is subtracted by the identity function, it becomes an element of the algebra of the velocity vector fields $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$.}
	\label{fig:se2_circular_vector_field}
\end{figure}

The set of \emph{deformations} is the set of continuous functions from $\Omega$ to $\Omega$, compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. If a deformation is invertible with continuous inverse, then it is called \emph{homeomorphism}; the set of homeomorphisms forms a group, indicated with $\text{Hom}(\Omega)$, with the operation of function composition. If an homeomorphism is differentiable and has differentiable inverse then it is called \emph{diffeomorphism}. Again the set of diffeomorphisms forms a group, indicated with $\text{Diff}(\Omega)$.

A \emph{velocity vector field} over $\Omega$ is a differentiable function that at each point of $\Omega$, associates a vector of $\mathbb{R}^d$; the set of velocity vector fields, indicated with $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ forms a vector space, and considering the Lie bracket defined by the directional derivative
we obtain that $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ forms a Lie algebra\footnote{
	Some books invert the signs of the operation (see the Kirillow's remarks \cite{kirillov2008introduction} pag. 27); this choice does not have any impact in the study of the algebraic structure, but it has an impact on the numerical results when the Lie brackets are implemented for numerical computations. At the moment the sign that defines the Lie bracket is chosen on the base of the obtained results.
}.
If $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{d}$ is a local coordinates system over $\Omega$, $\mathbf{u}=a^{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}$ and $\mathbf{v}=b^{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}$ are two elements of  $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ written using the Einstein summation convention, the Lie bracket can be expressed using the Jacobian:
\begin{align*}
[\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}] &= 
a^{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\big( b^{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}} \big)
-
b^{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\big( a^{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}} \big) \\
&=
a^{i} \frac{\partial b_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}  
+ 
a^{i}b^{j}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i}x_{j}}
- 
b^{j} \frac{\partial a^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} 
-
b^{j}a^{i}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{j}x_{i}} \\
&=
a^{i} \frac{\partial b_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}
-
b^{j} \frac{\partial a^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}} \\
&= 
J_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u} - J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}
\end{align*}

% here the two doors
It has been proved that the Lie algebra of the Lie group of diffeomorphisms $\text{Diff}(\Omega)$ is the vector space $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ considered with the Lie bracket (\cite{milnor1982infinite}, \cite{ovsienko1992integrals}). 
Therefore a single vector in the Lie algebra $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ (represented by one red arrow in figure \ref{fig:composition}) is a vector field defined over $\Omega$ (represented by the set of red arrows in figure \ref{fig:se2_circular_vector_field}). We would expect that to a single diffeomorphism in the Lie group corresponds a single vector of the Lie algebra. This is not the case, since Lie logarithm and Lie exponential are not local isomorphisms on the whole domain.

\subsection{Local isomorphisms for a subset of Diffeomorphisms: one-parameter subgroup and stationary velocity fields}\label{subse:local_isomorphisms}

In the case of matrices, the exponential map is a local isomorphisms: it is always possible to find an open neighbor of $\mathbf{0}$ in the Lie algebra and an open neighbor of the identity element in the Lie group (in the same topology induced by the metric inherited by the bigger algebra), such that the exponential map is defined and invertible.

In the infinite dimensional case there are diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not embedded into any one-parameter subgroups, therefore the exponential map is not a local isomorphism (see the counterexample in \cite{milnor1984remarks}, pag. 1017 or the definition of Koppel-diffeomorphisms \cite{grabowski1988free} pag. 115).

% subset of diff in which we are interested: the one that can be parmetrized by tangent vector fields
Since for medical image registration we are interested only in the diffeomorphisms that can be parametrized by tangent vector fields, this feature is worth being investigated, but it requires some definitions.

% two kinds of vector fields. TVVF SVF. A continuous way to produce diffeomorphims
If $\varphi$ is a one-parameter subgroup on the manifold $\text{\emph{Diff}}(\Omega)$, then its derivative satisfies the \emph{stationary} (or homogeneous) ordinary differential equation:
\begin{align}\label{eq:generating_ODE_svf}
\frac{d\varphi(t)}{dt} = V_{\varphi(t)}
\end{align}
where the stationary vector field $V_{\varphi(t)}$ defined over $\Omega$ is an element of the Lie algebra of $\mathcal{V}(\Omega)$ called \emph{stationary velocity field} (SVF). 
%In fact

Vice versa, given an SVF, thanks to Cauchy theorem, exists always a unique solution $\varphi$ to the ordinary differential equation (ODE) \ref{eq:generating_ODE_svf}, given the initial condition $\varphi(0) = 1$, that satisfies the property of one-parameter subgroup.

We indicate with $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ the \emph{set of diffeomorphisms embedded in a one parameter subgroup}, or the solutions of \ref{eq:generating_ODE_svf} for any differentiable vector field defined over $\Omega$ . 

%We notice that $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ does not form a group. In fact if $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are in $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ and satisfy respectively $\frac{d\varphi_1(t)}{dt} = U_{\varphi_1(t)}$ and $\frac{d\varphi_2(t)}{dt} = V_{\varphi_2(t)}$, then their composition $\varphi_1\circ\varphi_2$ does not satisfy any stationary ordinary differential equation. 
%To have closure for the composition of one parameter subgroup, 
We can extend our attention to non-stationary (or non-homogeneous or non-autonomous) ordinary differential equation of the form:
\begin{align}\label{eq:generating_ODE_tvvf}
\frac{d\psi(t)}{dt} = W_{(t, \psi(t))}
\end{align}
where $W_{(t, \psi(t))}$ is a non-stationary vector field, called here time varying vector field, or TVVF. 

When compared to the SVF, it does not depend only on the spatial position $\mathbf{x}$ but there is also a temporal dependency. 
Think for example to an artificial satellite orbiting around the globe: it is subject to the earth's vector field in respect to which it is constant for a fixed position, and to the lunar vector field that it is not fixed but varies with respect to the time. Conventionally the temporal domain $T$ contains the origin and formally we can write:
\begin{align*}
W : T\times \Omega & \longrightarrow  \mathbb{R}^d \\
(t, \psi(t)) &\longmapsto  W_{(t, \psi(t))}
\end{align*}
for $\psi$ diffeomorphism that, when applied to a point of $\Omega$ at the time $t$, is indicated with $\psi(t,\mathbf{x})$ or $\psi^{(t)}(\mathbf{x})$.

Non-stationary ODE are particular cases of a stationary ones. Writing the diffeomorphism $\psi(t)$ applied to $\mathbf{x}$ in local coordinates as 
\begin{align*}
\psi^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}) = (\psi_1^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}), \psi_2^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}), \dots ,\psi_d^{(t)}(\mathbf{x})) \in \mathbb{R}^{d}
\end{align*}
and defining a new function $\psi_0^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}) = t_0 + t$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \Omega$, we can obtain then the new diffeomorphism $\tilde{\psi}^{(t)}$ that in local coordinates is expressed as 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\psi}^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}) = (\psi_0^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}), \psi_1^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}), \psi_2^{(t)}(\mathbf{x}), \dots ,\psi_d^{(t)}(\mathbf{x})) \in T\times \mathbb{R}^{d}
\end{align*}
that reduces the ODE \ref{eq:generating_ODE_tvvf} to an ODE of the form \ref{eq:generating_ODE_svf}. In the example of the satellite, is like considering the temporal dimension as an additional dimension of the space.

It follows that stationary ODE and non-stationary ODE have solutions that belong to $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ and $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(T\times \Omega)$ respectively. %For each instant of time the solutions of a non-stationary ODE are embedded in the set of one-parameter subgroup of $\text{\emph{Diff}}(\Omega)$, but for two different instant of time, the solutions can belong to two different elements in the one parameter subgroups. 

In conclusion, we have that in the case of diffeomorphisms $\exp$ is not a local isomorphism, unless we restrict the group of diffeomorphisms to the one embedded in a one parameter subgroup $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(T\times \Omega)$. 
%In addition, indicating with $\text{SVF}$ the set of stationary velocity fields and with $\text{TVVF}$ the set of time varying velocity fields, we have that
%\begin{align*}
%\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega) &= \exp(\text{SVF}) = \exp(\text{TVVF})
%\end{align*}
%but to a given SVF exists only one one-parameter subgroup $\varphi$ that satisfies the ODE \ref{eq:generating_ODE_svf}. The same thing does not necessarily happens for the TVVF.

In the LDDMM framework \cite{beg2005computing} TVVFs are initially considered, while with the paper of Arsigny \cite{arsigny2006log}, and in subsequent works, the attention has been restricted to SVF. 
This is due to the fact that scaling and squaring algorithm and inverse scaling and squaring algorithm, as every numerical method based on the phase flow to compute the Lie exponential and the Lie logarithm, works only under the assumption that the transformation belongs to the same one-parameter subgroup.

\subsection{Toward a Bigger Vector Space for the Lie Algebra and the Lie Group of Diffeomorphisms}\label{subse:bigger_algebra}
As well as for any matrix Lie group, both the group $SE(2)$ and the algebra $\mathfrak{se}(2)$ are subset of the same bigger algebra of matrices in the general linear group $GL(3,\mathbb{R})$. The product of the algebra coincides with the composition of the group and thanks to the linearity, scalar product is compatible both with the product and the composition.

The existence of a bigger algebra is not important only in the research of an elegant structure: the power series expansions of the exponential (\ref{eq:exp_as_inf_sum}) and the logarithm (\ref{eq:log_as_inf_sum}) as well as expressions like (\ref{eq:prop_matrix_diff_log}) and (\ref{eq:prop_matrix_lim}) would be meaningless without the possibility of expressing the sum of two elements of a multiplicative group. Moreover, if the bigger algebra that contains both Lie group and Lie algebra exists, a unique norm in this space can be defined and utilized to compare elements in the both subspaces.

In the case of diffeomorphisms of the compact subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can not identify a bigger algebra that contains both Lie group and Lie algebra, but we can reach something similar than what happens for matrices mapping diffeomorphisms to velocity vector fields over $\Omega$. For this aim it is necessary to have some definitions at hand.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figures/exp_versus_v.pdf}
	\caption{For small deformations, the displacement field $\log(\varphi)$ and the tangent field $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, computed at the point $\mathbf{x}$ of $\Omega$, are close to each others.}
	\label{fig:exp_versus_v}
\end{figure}

There are two ways of associating a diffeomorphism $\varphi$ to a velocity vector field. The first one is elementary but fundamental in this context: if $\mathbf{x}$ is in $\Omega$ and $\varphi(\mathbf{x})$ is the new point after the transformation, then the new velocity vector field, called here \emph{displacement field of} $\varphi$ and indicated with $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, is the map $\mathbf{v}$ that at the point $\mathbf{x}$ associates the vector defined as the difference between $\varphi(\mathbf{x})$ and $\mathbf{x}$:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{V}(\varphi) = \mathbf{v}
\qquad \qquad
\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}) := \varphi(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x}  
\qquad
\forall \mathbf{x} \in \Omega
\end{align*}
Adding the identity to $\mathbf{v}$ does not give us back the initial diffeomorphism $\varphi$, since the new object is still a velocity vector field. We indicate this operation with $\mathcal{W}$:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{W}(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{v} + 1 
\end{align*}
It is interesting to notice that when $\mathbf{v}$ is small then the numerical value of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\exp$ are closed to each other, therefore $\mathcal{W}$ can be considered a good approximation of $\exp$ (see figure \ref{fig:exp_versus_v}); the very same happens for matrices (see equations (\ref{eq:small_rotation_matrices_approx}) and see the subtraction of the identity in equation (\ref{eq:log_as_inf_sum})).

The second way to associate a velocity vector field to $\varphi$ is to use the Lie logarithm defined in chapter \ref{ch:tools}. Relevant differences between $\mathcal{V}$ and $\log$ are that the first is defined for any diffeomorphism, but it does not possess any inverse, while the latter is defined only for local topological structures but it possesses the inverse $\exp$.

The Lie algebra $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ is the infinite dimensional vector space defined by the vector field over $\Omega$ and plays a similar role to the bigger algebra for matrices; 
needless to say it does not contain any diffeomorphism $\varphi$, but it contains the vector field associated to $\varphi$ using $\mathcal{V}$.

\subsection{A Norm for the Elements in the one-parameter subgroup}\label{subse:norm}
A metric between tangent vector fields of $\Omega$ can be defined as 
\begin{align}\label{def:metric_two_svf}
d(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) 
= 
\Big( \int_{\Omega} \euclideanMetric{\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}}_{L^2}^{2} d\mathbf{x} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{align} 
that naturally induces a metric on the Lie algebra.

The Lie group $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ does not possess any norm, but the corresponding displacement fields defined using $\mathcal{V}$, as element of $\text{Vect}(\Omega)$ can be considered with a norm. Given two diffeomorphisms $\varphi_0$ and $\varphi_1$ we have
\begin{align}\label{def:metric_two_displacement_field}
d^{1}(\varphi_0,\varphi_1) 
= 
\Big( \int_{\Omega} \euclideanMetric{\mathcal{V}(\varphi_0) - \mathcal{V}(\varphi_1)}_{L^2}^{2} d\mathbf{x} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{align} 
In this metric, we need to use $\mathcal{V}$ because the operation of subtraction is not defined for diffeomorphisms. We can although subtract the velocity vector fields associated through $\mathcal{V}$.
Despite the limitation that Lie algebra and Lie group of diffeomorphisms are not subset of any bigger algebra, thanks to $\mathcal{V} $ we can nevertheless consider a function that measures the distance between $\text{\emph{Diff}}^{1}(\Omega)$ and SVF:
\begin{align}\label{def:metric_one_svf_one_displacement_field}
g(\mathbf{u},\varphi) 
= 
\Big(\int_{\Omega} \euclideanMetric{\mathbf{u} - \mathcal{V}(\varphi)}_{L^2}^{2} d\mathbf{x} \Big)^{1/2}
\end{align} 
When $\varphi$ is written as $\exp(\mathbf{u})$, this last distance can be utilized to measure the error between $\exp(\mathbf{u})$ and its approximation $1+\mathbf{u}$.

The next section shows the parametrization of SVF utilized in the applications. It is followed by the presentation of the numerical methods employed for the computation of the Lie log-composition applied to SVF.

\subsection{Parametrization of SVF: Grids and Discretized Vector Fields}\label{se:parametrization_SVF}

Even if images are discrete objects, we model them as continuous functions. There are several motivations that led to this choice: as underlined by \cite{szeliski1994image}, images are discrete measurement of the continuous property of an object. Therefore it is reasonable to have a model as close as possible to the continuous object rather than to a set of discrete measurements. 
Certainly it is important to keep in mind the fact that the continuous approximation is obtained - in a non unique way - from the discretized image with an interpolation scheme. This implies that, if the distance between two separate objects is less than the size of a unitary element (pixel/voxel), in a continuous approximation based on the discretized image the two objects objects will not be separated anymore. 

Furthermore transformations between images are discretized vector fields, where each vector is applied to an element of a grid. These transformations can only be considered as a model of the group of diffeomorphisms (a model of a model, in image registration!) and reflects only partially the continuous property of the original transformation.
In turn, the use of discretized elements allows for the computerisation of the solutions.

The data structure utilized to store images, as well as displacement fields, is a 5-dimensional matrix
\begin{align}\label{eq:basic_data_structure}
M = M(x_i,y_j,z_k,t,d) \qquad (i,j,k)\in L , ~~ t \in T  ~~ d = 1,2,3
\end{align}
where $(x_i,y_j,z_k)$ are the discrete positions on a lattice $L$ in the domain of the images, $t$ is the time parameter in a discretized domain $T$ and $d$ is the index of the coordinate axis. So, the discretized \emph{tangent vector} $\mathbf{v}_{\tau}(x_i,y_j,z_k)$ at time $t$, has coordinates defined by
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_{t}(x_i,y_j,z_k) = (M(x_i,y_j,z_k,t ,1), M(x_i,y_j,z_k,t,2), M(x_i,y_j,z_k,t ,3))
\end{align*}

\subsection{Computations of Log-composition for SVF}\label{se:log_composition_SVF}
The Lie bracket that appears in the truncated $BCH$ of degree $0,1,1.5$ and $2$ for SVF, are computed using the Jacobian matrix $J$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:jacobian_product}
[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}] 
:= 
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v} \cdot\mathbf{u}  
= 
J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u}  
\qquad
\forall \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v} \in \mathfrak{g}
\end{align}
Therefore the truncated approximation of the BCH formula presented in the equation (\ref{eq:bch_definition}) becomes:
\begin{align*}
BCH^{0}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) &= \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \\
BCH^{1}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) &=  \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \frac{1}{2}(J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u}  )\\
BCH^{3/2}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) 
&=  
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \frac{1}{2}(J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u}  ) + 
\frac{1}{12}\big( 
2 J_{\mathbf{u}} J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v} +2 J_{\mathbf{u}} J_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}
- 
J_{(J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u} )}\mathbf{u} 
\big) 
\\
BCH^{2}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) 
&=  
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} + \frac{1}{2}(J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u}) 
\\
&+ 
\frac{1}{12}\big( 
2 J_{\mathbf{u}} J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v} +2 J_{\mathbf{u}} J_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}
- 
J_{(J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v} - J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})}\mathbf{u} 
+
2 J_{\mathbf{v}} J_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u} +2 J_{\mathbf{v}} J_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}
- 
J_{(J_{u}\mathbf{v} - J_{v}\mathbf{u})}\mathbf{v} 
\big) 
\end{align*}
Lie brackets of SVF can become extremely small, in particular, as we will see in chapter \ref{ch:results}, when the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter that generates the fields is small. \\
It is not known how to apply Taylor method presented in \ref{se:taylor_expansion} for the SVF, but the method based on the parallel transport is a direct consequence of equation (\ref{eq:parallel_transport}):
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{u}_0\oplus \mathbf{u}_1
&\simeq
\mathbf{u}_0 
+
\exp_{e}\big(\frac{\mathbf{u}_0}{2}\big)   
\circ  \exp_{e}(\mathbf{u}_1) 
\circ \exp_{e}\big(-\frac{\mathbf{u}_0}{2}\big)
-
e
\end{align*}
Here the exponential function can be computed with several algorithms (scaling and squaring, forward Euler, composition method, poser series expansion - see \cite{bossa2008algorithms} for a comparison of their performances). Following the original setting of the Log-euclidean metric proposed in \cite{arsigny2006log} we use the scaling and squaring, keeping in mind that this choice affects the results.
